Emacs Netlist Modes
===================

This is a fork of the Emacs netlist modes found at
http://spice-mode.4t.com/ . Real work was done by Geert Van der Plas,
Emmanuel Rouat & Brennan Sharp. I have made some small changes for my
system, and compatibility with Emacs 24.

As far as I can tell, all the code is under GPL.
