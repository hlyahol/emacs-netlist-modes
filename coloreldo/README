Coloreldo
---------

This is a simple wrapper for making the output from eldo easier to read
(more colorful).  It is based on Bjarni R. Einarsson's 'colormake' package
in turn inspired by Micheal T. Babcock's excellent logcolorize program.


Files
-----

coloreldo.pl   A perl filter, which colorizes eldo's output.
celdo          A shell script, which combines eldo and coloreldo.pl

The rest is documentation.


Installation
------------

cp coloreldo.pl celdo /usr/local/bin/


Usage
-----

Type "celdo" instead of 'eldo'
